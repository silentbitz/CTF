Description: Can you find the flag in the disk image?


Solution: 

There is a downloadable link in the description. 

1. I used 'curl -O <url>'
2. This gave me a file back that was a .gz file
3. I used 'gunzip filename.gz' this gave me .dd file, a disk image which is also a binary file.
4. I then used 'strings <filename> | grep pico'
5. This returned the flag picoCTF{1t5_ju5t_4_5tr1n9_e3408eef}



Why is chose this route:

The reason or thought process behind this is because with binary files or any files in that case you can sometimes ffind human readable strings in the files, in CTF's this is a key step because sometimes the flag hides in those.
